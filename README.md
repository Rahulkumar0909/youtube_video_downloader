# Youtube Video Downloader

## Description:
* #### Paste the url or string containing urls in the `input.txt` file and run the `file.py` code in same directory.
* #### You will get `updated_url.txt` file which will contain the urls from which you can directly download the video in `.mp4` OR audio in `.mp3` format.
* #### Recomended using `Open Multiple URLs` as browser extenshion for multiple video downloads.

## Open Multiple URLs 
* #### One of the great extenshion for browser. It opens all URLs in different tab at the same time. (saves lot of time)
* ### Tip: You can copy the converted URLs from `updated_url.txt` file and open all at once.
